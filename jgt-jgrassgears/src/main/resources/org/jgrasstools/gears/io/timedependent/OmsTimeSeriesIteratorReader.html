Utility class for reading data from a OMS formatted csv file. The file needs a metadata line containing the id of the station. The table is supposed to have a first column of timestamp and all other columns of data related to the ids defined. This reader reads a time series data file step by step, so it is time dependent, if you need to read a time series all in one please refer to TimeSeriesReader.
<br>
This model allow the user to aggregate data for working with different timesteps. This means that if you will work with a different timestep respect to the data original one, you simply need to specify the number of timesteps to aggregate (number of rows) as an integer value and the operation that you would do with the aggregated data, sum or average.
