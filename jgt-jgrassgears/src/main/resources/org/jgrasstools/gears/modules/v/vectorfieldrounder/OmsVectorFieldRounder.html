Module that rounds a defined field attribute. The rounding pattern has to be provided with the standard Java convention. More information about how to use the patterns are available in the <a href="http://www.exampledepot.com/egs/java.text/FormatNum.html"> Java Almanac </a>.
<br>
For example if you want to round values in a double field to have only two decimals you can use the following pattern <i>#.##</i> or <i>#.00</i>
if you decide that the numbers have to have always two decimals, in case of just one a zero will be added at the end.
