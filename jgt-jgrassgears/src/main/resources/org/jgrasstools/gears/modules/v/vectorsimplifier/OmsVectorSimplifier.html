Collection of vector simplification algorithms. This model works on all kind of feature types (point, line or polygon), obviously the simplification of a point layer is nonsense.
<br>
Simplification is used to reducing the number of points in a geometry that is approximated by a series of points.
<br>
There are two different simplification algorithms integrated in this module:
<ul>
<li> 0 : TopologyPreservingSimplifier: simplifies a geometry, ensuring that the result is a valid geometry having the same dimension and number of components as the input. The simplification uses a maximum distance difference algorithm similar to the one used in the Douglas-Peucker algorithm</li>
<li> 1 : Douglas Peucker: a detailed description of this method is available in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer%E2%80%93Douglas%E2%80%93Peucker_algorithm"> Wikipedia </a></li>
</ul>

</ul>
