<ul>
<li>extract map sub areas with values between the given lower and upper threshold</li>
<li>extract the map in the area defined of the mask map </li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the map that has to be processed</li>
<li>the file containing the map to use as mask</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the file containing the result of thresholding or masking</li> 
</ul>
