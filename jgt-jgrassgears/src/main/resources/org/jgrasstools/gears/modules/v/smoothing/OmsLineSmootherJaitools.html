The line smoother from the Jaitools project that uses the Bezier curve to smooth. More info on the algorithm are available in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve"> Wikipedia </a>

<h3>Inputs</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the vector containing the lines to be smoothed</li>
<li>a value between 0 and 1 (inclusive) specifying the tightness of fit of the smoothed boundary (0 is loose - default)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Output</h3>
<ul>      
<li>the vector with smoothed features</li> 
</ul>
